# calcStepApp

See the [architecture documentation](./Supporting%20Documents/architecture.md) to get an overview of the code.


## Setup

- have a look at the setup of the 'internationalisation' of the app to make sure that the automatic files are generated [l10n documentation](./Supporting%20Documents/i18n-l10n.md)

- in `./stepCalc`, run `flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs`

- with `flutter run` you can execute the app

- if there are any problems don't hesitate to contact me: <faubel.julius@egmail.com>
